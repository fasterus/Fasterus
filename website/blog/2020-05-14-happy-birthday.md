Today we celebrate two years developing.
A year ago, we summarized up the results for the year. We wrote the following:

```text
The work does not stop, but the pace is increasing more and more,
and in a year there will be great results 
```
And then a challenging, busy year passed. Excellent results have indeed been achieved, but human nature always requires more.

We planned by this time to go to open source. Since we thought that no one would want to deal with us until the product is in the Open Source. We thought it could be afraid for a company that the development will stop, and the company will stay with legacy. But surprisingly, we were wrong, and we got contracts that we are working hard on now. Thanks to which we receive funding to work on our project. This does not mean that we left the idea of ​​publishing in the public domain; just now, we do not have enough resources for this task. In the near future, we plan to expand slightly in order to accelerate this process. And we will try at least once a month to publish information on the blog about how things are going with us.

We do not stop. We move to new heights to give you a product which helps your faster achieve excellent your goals too.
