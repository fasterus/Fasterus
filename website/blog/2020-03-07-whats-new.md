The last two weeks were tough for us. We stabilized our backend service and finished all the rest tasks. During work, we found little bugs and inaccuracies, which successfully fixed.  Now we almost ready to publish binary executable files of our project. 

Our plans for the next two weeks:

* Checking our project in the real task. This should help to us found rest bugs.
* Writing huge documentation parts and articles for more introduce you with our project. 

I hope that in two weeks we will finally publish our binary executables. And you finally get the opportunity to try it.

If you have questions, you can always ask us in any [social networking](/community).
