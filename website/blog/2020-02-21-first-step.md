Our project is certainly not as grand as the conquest of the moon.
But we are taking our first step and hope for your support.
Our story began on May 14, 2018, I started doing the first MVP version of the project.
In April 2019, a JS junior programmer joined the project to help create the application interface.

The first version was already ready in a couple of weeks and represent GUI of the application without complex logic work(without compilation ready solution just work-interface of application).
This first version solution I start a show to potential future customers of this product.
The first year was spent on experiments and led to a complete rethinking of the project.

The idea of the project is to minimize the user level for entering programming, 
to increase quality and, 
the efficiency of current programmers by reducing repetitive actions. 
Users focus on business logic and not on the whole code.

In more detail about what we have at the moment, we will write later.
I planned for earlier to publish the source code of the project in open access, 
but in a current day, there are a couple of non-closed tasks, 
which prevent from doing it. But soon we will do it ;)

This is our first step! Yes, he is not as big as we wanted, but we are on the move. 

Subscribe for news in any way convenient for you, all the links are in the basement of the site.
Soon we will publish documentation and binary executable files of our project.
